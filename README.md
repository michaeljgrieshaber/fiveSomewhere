## Overview

This site allows users to finally answer the question nobody is asking in response to the statement "It's 5 O'Clock somewhere". Once on the site, users will be able to see where exactly it's 5 O'Clock in the world by country & timezone. They will also see their time, timezone, and be able to listen to a classic song.
